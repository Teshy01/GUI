        <p>One of the best generations of Pokemon of all time is generation 
            four. The starter Pokemon in this generation had some of the coolest
            designs of all time, and the storyline was extremely interesting.
            The gameplay in this generation was also incredible, as difficulty was
            amped up and trainers would find themselves stuck between a rock and 
            a hard place. As a child, I enjoyed playing through these games, and I put in
            a ton of effort to finish the game, post-game content, and the pokedex. 
            Finishing the whole game and having all the pokemons allowed you to brag 
            to your friends about how many hours you put into this brilliant game. For me,
            the start of this game was one of my favorite parts, since this game had, in 
            my opinion, the best three starters of all time. Chimchar, Piplup and Turtwig
            were all brilliant starter Pokemon, and I loved each and every one of them. 
            This webpage is dedicated to giving you a rundown on each of the starters, and
            help you admire each of them as well!

        <p>
            Chimchar is my favorite pokemon in this generation. He is the fire starter of this generation, 
            and he is based off monkeys. He later evolves into a fighting fire type menace, which is extremely
            good late game. Below is a table of all the moves Chimchar learns by level up:

            My final paragraph for the first pokemon is written below, with my thoughts
        -->
        <p>
            As you can see, the moveset is not really that great. That's why most people use TMs on Chimchar to
            make him insanely good. One of the best TMs you can teach Chimchar is flamethrower (you can learn
            this by level up as well, but it takes a long time to learn this move), and the move works beautifully 
            with him if he has good special attack. Another fun moveset to run on him is all the punching moves, such 
            as Thunder Punch, Fire Punch, Ice Punch and Mach Punch. If your Chimchar is a physical attacker, this moveset 
            works brilliantly, as he has moves that could counter his weakness(such as flying and grass types). 
            For more information on Chimchar, refer to the link below:

        <p>
            Piplup, one of the cutest generation four pokemon, is probably my second favorite starter pokemon from
            this generation. It is the starting water type of this generation, and it has an awesome final evolution
            typing of water and steel. This pokemon was based of a penguin, and its definitely one of the best pokemon
            in this generation due to the lack of water types. Here is Piplup's full level up moveset:

            The moves Piplup has are actually quite powerful compared to Chimchar. Piplup, having steel and water type, is a huge advantage since both of those 
            types are basically hard to find throughout this game. Piplup is definitely a wonderful pick for a starter. For more information on Piplup, refer

            Turtwig, the cutest of the three starters, is probably the most versatile of all of the starters in this generation. This starting grass type pokemon
            becomes a ground type after evolving, and it utterly demolishes ninety percent of the gyms in the league. It definitely is the best starter pokemon out of
            the three. Here is Turtwig's full moveset:

            Unfortunately, Turtwig doesn't learn any ground type moves after evolving, but you can always teach him Earthquake. Earthquake
            is an exteremly powerful move that can help you defeat your opponents with no problem. For more information on Turtwig, you can
